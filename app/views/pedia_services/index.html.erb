<h1>PEDIA Service</h1>

<p>PEDIA Service is a website which provides user with the service of performing PEDIA scoring approach.
By submitting the JSON file of your case which your receive from Face2Gene and a
VCF from exome sequencing experiment, we will calculate the Phenomizer and Boqa
score based on the HPO term and annotate the CADD score of the variants in VCF.
After obtain all the scores, we then run the PEDIA classifier to calculate the PEDIA
score for each gene. For more detail about the software, please refer our project
